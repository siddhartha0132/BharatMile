        Goa is widely known for its beaches, nightlife, and party energy, but the state has a much deeper soul that many travelers miss entirely. Beyond the wave-filled shorelines lies an untouched side of Goa — a Goa filled with ancient forts, lush green spice plantations, local farming communities, wildlife-rich countryside, and stories of Portuguese, Maratha, and colonial influence. If you’re someone who wants more than just beach hopping and clubbing, this 2000+ word guide takes you into the real Goa — peaceful, historic, cultural, and beautifully raw.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Whether you are a solo traveler, couple, family, or someone visiting Goa for the first time, exploring forts and spice farms gives a wholesome experience. The forts provide breathtaking views of the Arabian Sea, while the spice plantations let you step into the world of traditional Goan agriculture. This guide covers everything: must-visit spots, timings, entry fees, safety tips, best seasons, itineraries, food recommendations, and how to plan a perfect heritage day in Goa.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🏰 Must-Visit Forts in Goa</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Goa has over a dozen forts, but only a few gain regular attention. These forts were once lookouts, defense structures, trade monitoring points, and strategic coastal watch towers during Portuguese rule. Today, they act as peaceful viewpoints, photography locations, and historical sites. Here are the best ones you should not miss.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">1. Aguada Fort</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Aguada Fort is one of Goa’s most preserved and famous landmarks. Built in 1612 by the Portuguese, it served as a defense base against Dutch and Maratha invasions. The lighthouse inside the fort once guided ships approaching the Mandovi River. Today, tourists come here mainly for the viewpoint — a panoramic look at the Arabian Sea stretching endlessly.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Early morning or sunset.<br />
        <strong>Entry fee:</strong> Free.<br />
        <strong>Timing:</strong> 9 AM – 5:30 PM.<br />
        <strong>Photography:</strong> Perfect for wide-angle shots.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2. Chapora Fort</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Famously known as the <em>Dil Chahta Hai</em> fort, Chapora is a traveler favorite for its cinematic sunset view. The climb is moderate, but once you reach the top, the 360° view of Vagator Beach, Chapora River, and the green cliffs makes everything worth it.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Sunset lovers, photographers, trekkers.<br />
        <strong>Entry fee:</strong> Free.<br />
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid slippers; the trail can be slippery during monsoons.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3. Reis Magos Fort</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Reis Magos is an underrated architectural beauty. Restored beautifully with yellow laterite stone and Portuguese windows, it now houses a museum showing Goa’s colonial history. Located along the Mandovi River, this fort is quieter than Aguada and Chapora — making it perfect for peaceful travelers.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Entry Fee:</strong> ₹50 for adults, ₹20 for children.<br />
        <strong>Timing:</strong> 9:30 AM – 5 PM (Closed on Mondays).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🌿 Spice Farms in Goa</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Goa’s spice farms sit mostly in Ponda, surrounded by dense forests and natural springs. These plantations are peaceful, informative, and refreshing — a complete contrast to the beachside tourist bustle. You get guided tours, traditional Goan meals, elephant interactions (seasonal), and a peek into sustainable agriculture.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">1. Sahakari Spice Farm</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This is the most popular spice farm in Goa. The tour includes walks through plantations of cardamom, pepper, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and betel nut. Guides explain how each spice is grown and processed. After the tour, you’re served an authentic Goan buffet cooked with traditional spices.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Entry fee:</strong> ₹500–₹600 (includes buffet).<br />
        <strong>Time needed:</strong> 2–3 hours.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2. Tropical Spice Plantation</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        One of the greenest and most photogenic plantations in Ponda, Tropical Spice Plantation is known for bird spotting, elephant baths, wooden bridges, and immersive farming tours. The atmosphere is quiet, natural, and full of greenery.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Nature lovers, families, eco-tourists.<br />
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Wear comfortable shoes; the paths are muddy during monsoon.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">✨ Why Explore Beyond Beaches?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Goa beyond beaches is calmer, more authentic, and far more connected to local life. Many first-time visitors only see Baga, Calangute, and Tito's Lane — which is just 10% of Goa. Forts show you history. Spice plantations show you culture. Rural roads show you everyday Goan life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">📌 Best Time to Visit Forts & Spice Farms</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>October – March:</strong> Best weather, pleasant for walking.</li>
        <li><strong>July – September:</strong> Greenest views, great for plantations.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> April–May afternoons; too hot for fort climbs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🚗 How to Reach These Places</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Forts are mostly in North Goa, while spice farms are in Ponda (Central Goa). Renting a scooter is the easiest and cheapest way to explore. Taxis cost more but are comfortable. Public buses are available but less frequent.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Scooter rental:</strong> ₹400–₹600 per day</li>
        <li><strong>Taxi:</strong> ₹1500–₹2500 for a half-day trip</li>
        <li><strong>Local bus:</strong> ₹20–₹40 (slow but affordable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🛡️ Safety Tips for Travelers</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>Wear shoes at forts — stones can be sharp.</li>
        <li>Avoid going too close to cliff edges.</li>
        <li>Carry water; forts require walking.</li>
        <li>Protect yourself from monkeys (don’t hold food outside).</li>
        <li>Use offline maps; signal drops in Ponda.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">🍲 What to Eat Nearby</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>Chicken Xacuti</li>
        <li>Prawn Curry Rice</li>
        <li>Bebinca dessert</li>
