      <p className="mb-4">
        Visiting the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar isn’t just another travel plan — it’s an experience that shifts something inside you. The sound of the shabad kirtan echoing across the sarovar, the sight of the golden sanctum glowing under the sun, the kindness of volunteers running the world’s largest community kitchen… everything here feels pure, peaceful, and deeply human. Whether you're coming for spiritual reasons, cultural curiosity, photography, or just inner stillness, this guide will take you through everything you need to know to make your visit effortless, meaningful, and unforgettable.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">✨ A Glimpse Into the Golden Temple Experience</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Golden Temple remains open nearly 20 hours a day — from around 3 AM till 11 PM — and each hour has its own unique energy. Early mornings are serene with soft chanting. Evenings are magical as the temple glows like a floating jewel. And late-night darshan, when the crowds reduce, feels almost meditative.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The moment you enter the complex, you’ll notice everyone moves slowly, respectfully. Shoes are left outside, heads are covered, and visitors wash their hands and feet before stepping inside. The marble floors, the calm water of the sarovar, and the rhythmic chants create an environment that pulls you inward. It doesn’t matter whether you’re religious or not — this place has a way of making you pause and breathe.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">📜 A Brief History of the Golden Temple</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The foundation of the Golden Temple was laid in 1581 by Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth Sikh Guru. What makes this temple different from most religious structures is its design — it is built below ground level to symbolize humility, and it has four entrances instead of one, representing that all people, from all directions, are welcome regardless of caste, gender, religion, or status.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Over the centuries, the temple has been reconstructed, expanded, and beautified multiple times. The gold plating that gives it its iconic look came in the early 19th century under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Today, the temple stands not only as a major spiritual center but also as a symbol of equality and service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🍲 The Langar: World’s Largest Free Kitchen</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        One of the most extraordinary aspects of the Golden Temple is the langar — a free community kitchen that serves simple vegetarian meals to anyone who walks in. No discrimination, no hierarchy, no separation. Everyone sits together on the floor, sharing the same food.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Daily, up to **1–2 lakh people** are fed, and during peak days, this number crosses 3 lakh. Volunteers known as "sewadars" prepare, cook, serve, and clean. Watching the seva being done with such devotion teaches you more about humanity than any book ever could.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Meals include roti, dal, sabzi, kheer, and sometimes kadhi.</li>
        <li>Volunteers roll nearly 2 lakh rotis a day.</li>
        <li>Anyone can volunteer — even tourists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">🛕 Darshan Guide: What to Expect</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Reaching the main sanctum (the inner Golden Temple where the Guru Granth Sahib is placed) might take 30 minutes on a low day and up to 2–3 hours on weekends or holidays. The queue moves slowly but peacefully. Inside, you get a close view of the holy scripture while devotional music plays.
      </p>
